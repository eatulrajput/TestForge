# Unit Test Generation Report

## Approach
- Used Codellama via Ollama for local LLM inference
- Instructions provided via structured YAML prompts
- Built pipeline with generation → refinement → build → coverage

## Tools
- C++17
- Google Test
- Ollama with Codellama
- gcov for coverage

## Test Coverage
- Functions tested: 3/4
- Line coverage: 85%
- Branch coverage: 71%

## Improvements
- Removed duplicate tests
- Fixed missing includes
- Improved test structure and naming

## Conclusion
The system is modular, repeatable, and LLM-guided using YAML.
